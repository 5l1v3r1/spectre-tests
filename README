This repository contains some simple tests for the spectre bug.  This attack
is described at https://meltdownattack.com/ and has more reading material at
https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.hk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html

While my original source for the code is from the contents of a github gist,
reading the Spectre paper reveals that this code is included in that paper as
their example implementation.
